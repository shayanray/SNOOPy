# Inspiration
A lot of our inspirations came from security cameras and spy cams. 

# Snoopy (MakeHarvard 2019)

The product is essentially a teddy bear spy cam. The camera activates when there is motion detected and starts to record. Video saved is only the essential footage you need of the intruder motion, you don't need to go through hours of un-necessary stationary scenes.
