# Inspiration
A lot of our inspirations came from security cameras and spy cams. 

# Snoopy (MakeHarvard 2019)

The product is essentially a teddy bear spy cam. The camera activates when there is motion detected and starts to record. Video saved is only the essential footage you need of the intruder motion, you don't need to go through hours of un-necessary stationary scenes.


# Built With

Arduino

Adafruit

esp8266breakout

c++

python

openCV 3.3.1

80/20 composites



## Description: The SNOOPy is an innocent teddy bear that sits on your shelf, sofa, or anywhere in your house and has a hidden camera inside it. The camera is activated by motion sensors and is able to follow motion by turning its head.

>Whether it be intruders or your pesky siblings taking your leftovers from the fridge, the teddy bear will keep a close watch and make a home-made video for you to watch later!

## What it does 
The product is essentially a teddy bear spy cam. The camera activates when there is motion detected and starts to record. Video saved is only the essential footage you need of the intruder motion, you don't need to go through hours of un-necessary stationary scenes.

## How we built it
<ol>
<li> Borrowed a real teddy !!  </li>
<li> Built the skeleton of the teddy bear with 80/20 composite materials </li>
<li> With Computer Vision in place and the Stepper Motor motion detection and teddy's head rotation was possible </li>
<li> Added a Recording feature - to make your own home made video of just the essential intrusion frames and not hours and hours of unwanted footage. </li>
</ol>


## Challenges we ran into
<ul>
<li>Some of the challenges we encountered were that we couldn't find the right equipment (camera, motor etc.) initially. </li>
<li>Attaching the motor to the 80/20 skeleton </li>
<li>Delivering the right amount of power to the motor </li>
<li>Saving only the useful frames of intrusion as a video </li>
</ul>

## What we learned
Teddy's are cute but snoopy is Awesome!
On a serious note, OpenCV, Arduino, composities all together take a lot of work to sync up!

## What's next for SNOOPy
We hope to put SNOOPy into a real-life application and add an extra layer of protection to our homes. The video could be saved to your google drive as a future action for your viewing later.
